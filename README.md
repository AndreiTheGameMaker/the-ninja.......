Game Title: Ninja Brawl:
Description: Ninja Brawl is an exciting third-person action RPG where players take control of a skilled ninja in a world full of enemies and challenges. The game features dynamic combat, leveling up, and progression mechanics as players battle through waves of enemies, gain XP, and upgrade their abilities. The gameplay centers around using both stealth and strategy, as players engage in combat with enemy ninjas, using their agility and weapons to outmaneuver and defeat their foes.

Key features of the game:

Third-Person Perspective: Control the ninja from behind, enjoying an immersive view of the action as the camera dynamically follows your character.

Combat Mechanics: Utilize two main weapons — a ninja bat and a sniper rifle — to fight against hostile ninjas. The system includes both melee and ranged combat options.

XP & Progression: Gain experience points (XP) by defeating enemies. Level up to unlock new abilities, improve your stats, and become an even stronger ninja.

HP System: Keep track of your health (HP) as you face enemies. Damage is taken when you get hit, and you can recover health during gameplay.

Player Customization: Name your ninja and track your progress with saved data (HP, XP, and player name) to continue your journey without losing progress.

Persistent Save System: Your progress is saved in a text file, allowing you to load your data even after restarting the game. Your character’s stats, level, and name are saved and can be restored easily.

The game blends elements of role-playing games (RPGs) with real-time combat and a third-person view for a thrilling, action-packed experience. Your mission as the ninja is to fight through increasingly difficult enemies, gaining XP and upgrading your abilities while enjoying the immersive third-person perspective.

Platform: PC (via SFML library for C++ development)
